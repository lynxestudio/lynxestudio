## Hi there:

My name is Martin Albert Ortega, I'm a software engineer.
I started out as a English literature student, but while studying at Facultad de Filosofia y letras UNAM, discovered the joys of programming then I decided
to study administrative systems in Universidad del Valle de Mexico.
I currently hold a master degree of sytems engineering from Universidad del Valle de Mexico.

For the past twelve years, I had architected and developed software for a variety of industries, including banking industry, insurance companies and goverment ministers.
