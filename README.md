My name is Martin Ortega-Marquez, I'm a software engineer.
I started out as a English literature student, but while studying at Facultad de Filosofia y letras UNAM, discovered the joys of programming then I decided
to study administrative systems in Universidad del Valle de Mexico UVM.
I currently hold a master degree of sytems engineering from Universidad del Valle de Mexico UVM.

For the past twelve years, I had architected and developed software for a variety of industries, including banking industry, insurance companies and goverment ministries.

The technologies I use for building software:
<table>
<tr>
<td>Programming languages</td>
<td>Databases</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Communications</td>
<td>Cybersecurity</td>
</tr>
</table>
