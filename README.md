## Hi there, welcome:

<p align="justify">
My name is Martin Ortega-Marquez, I'm a software engineer.
I started out as a English literature student, but while studying at Facultad de Filosofia y letras UNAM, discovered the joys of programming then I decided
to study administrative systems in Universidad del Valle de Mexico UVM.
I currently hold a master degree of sytems engineering from Universidad del Valle de Mexico UVM.

For the past twelve years, I had architected and developed software for a variety of industries, including banking industry, insurance companies and goverment ministries.

This is my personal repository for the technologies I usually use for building products.
Here you will find samples that I use for showing concepts, because in my opinion being a engineer it is about
how the things works in order to modify them and solve problems.
